The zip contains versions 1.10, 1.20, 1.30 and 1.31. There is a translated Editor.exe and an untranslated one, but not everything is translated. That's because some things can't be changed. 
I've done this for people who want to see what the old version looked like.

If you're going to test it, make sure the system localization is in Japanese!!!
