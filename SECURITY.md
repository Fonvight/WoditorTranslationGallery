## Supported Versions

Because there are so many versions of WolfRPGEditor, it's hard to keep track of them all. But right now I accept versions 1 and 3.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Ver.3   | :white_check_mark: |
| Ver.1   | :white_check_mark:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I'm a beginner on github, so I don't know what to write :P
