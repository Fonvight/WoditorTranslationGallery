## How the translations is done

There are two way to translate WolfRPGEditor:

### 1Â° By modifying the Editor.exe

By doing this way, you will have to translate all new or previous versions, and there's also a risk of it being corrupted.

Download the Editor [here](https://silversecond.com/WolfRPGEditor/Download.shtml)

<br/>

### 2Â° By modifying the Editor.Lang.dll (The way the translation is done)

Dll file contains all the WolfRPGEditor resources (menu, commands, stringtables and etc.), when the file in the same place as Editor.exe and open the Editor. All text will be replaced by the dll file. 

This way, you can keep reusing the dll in other versions, but at some point it will stop working or some features will be missing. When this happens, you should update the dll.

Download the dll [here](https://silversecond.com/WolfRPGEditor/Download.shtml#dll)
